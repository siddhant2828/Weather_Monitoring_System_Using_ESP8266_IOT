# Weather_Monitoring_System_Using_ESP8266_IOT
Iot based weather monitoring system using DHT11(humidity and temperature sensor) and BMP180(pressure sensor)
Objectives:
To design and develop an IoT-based weather monitoring system that can accurately measure and monitor temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.
To integrate the DHT11 sensor and BMP180 sensor to measure and report real-time temperature and humidity levels.
